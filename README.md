You can use this in CLI with node.js or GUI with the html file.

If yo want to use CLI do:

```bash
node baseConverter.js 1010 2 10
```

This will convert `1010` from binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10), giving the result `10`.

If you want to use GUI you can just open the html file in a web browser.
